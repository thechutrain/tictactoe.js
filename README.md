# tictactoe.js

A browser-based take on the classic boardgame, battleship.js is a project that I worked on for fun to learn javascript and jQuery. Enjoy!

## Things to Do:

There are a lot of things to do to make this project even better. I've divided the work into bugs to fix and addition work, which tend to be more of code writing.

	<li> fix the links in this read me file</li>
	<li><strike>initialize new game does not reset ship_container, just keeps added a new set of ships</strike></li>
